🌫️ **BlueSky Lofi Fragments**  
Whisker-synced loops for scrollcraft, ritual dispatches, and ambient resonance.

This repository holds a collection of lofi sound fragments—each one tuned for fog-bound posting, feline overlays, and timestamped lineage. Designed for modular remix, every track invites you to drop your scroll, layer your glyphs, and echo your cadence across the BlueSky scrollspace.

🔁 **Remix Rituals & Lineage Logging**  
Each fragment carries a timestamped lineage. Remixers are invited to:

- Credit the **starter loop** and its origin scroll  
- Annotate emotional or technical shifts (e.g. BPM, overlays, vibe)  
- Timestamp their dispatch with scrollworthy intent  
- Add poetic notes or remix rationale  
- Link to remix threads on non-algorithmic platforms (e.g. Bluesky)

Lineage logs are embedded in the HTML scroll via `<details>` blocks beneath each track. These logs honor remix ancestry, starter credit, and dispatch context.

🌀 **How to Contribute**  
- Fork the repo  
- Add your remix to the appropriate folder  
- Update the HTML scroll with your track and lineage log  
- Submit a pull request with timestamp and remix notes  

Starter credits and remix lineage will be honored in the scrollspace.
