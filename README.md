🌫️ BlueSky Lofi Fragments
Whisker-synced loops for scrollcraft, ritual dispatches, and ambient resonance.

This repository holds a collection of lofi sound fragments—each one tuned for fog-bound posting, feline overlays, and timestamped lineage. Designed for modular remix, each track invites you to drop your scroll, layer your glyphs, and echo your cadence across the BlueSky scrollspace.

🔁 Remix Rituals & Lineage Logging
Every fragment carries a timestamped lineage. Remixers are invited to:

Credit the starter loop and its origin scroll

Annotate emotional or technical shifts (e.g. BPM, overlays, vibe)

Timestamp their dispatch with scrollworthy intent

Add poetic notes or remix rationale

Link to remix threads on non-algorithmic platforms (e.g. Bluesky)

Lineage logs are embedded in the HTML scroll via <details> blocks beneath each track. These logs honor remix ancestry, starter credit, and dispatch context.
